# Getting started with React Todo App

A complete todo application with all features.

## Project Description

In this project, we will be creating a Complete Todo Application with all features. We will do all the CRUD operations. We will use React.js and to manage our states, we will use Redux and Redux-toolkit. Also we will use simple animations using Framer Motion. For styling our content, we will use Sass, react-icons and react-hot-toast and many more.

### Requirements

You are required to implement a small app in React JS that allows a user to view the completion status of a to-do list. Filter out the task on the basis of their completion status (complete and incomplete).

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
